<h1 align="center">AI Cracktime Estimator (AI Twist)</h1>

An AI-powered tool that predicts how long it would take to crack a given password.
This project uses machine learning to estimate crack time based on password features such as length, complexity, and character variety.
It includes a Flask web app with a simple UI to test password strength in real-time.
